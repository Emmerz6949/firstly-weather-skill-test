# Firstly Weather Skill Test

## Description

This repository was created so I could create a weather MERN application that will show the current weather for the searched for zip code. Users can also add zip codes to a list of favorites which will show when they click on the the search box.

You can use the commits to follow my journey.

### How did I do it?

I used JavaScript, JSON, JSX, the React.js framework and its many default dependencies, and the following additional installed via npm Node.js packages: "axios", "bootstrap", and "express" to write my code. I also used MongoDB via an installed npm Node.js package called "mongoose".



### Installation & Usage

Make sure you have Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/), MongoDB Community Server(https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server), and Docker Desktop(https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed. And after you've cloned or downloaded your forked repository use the command "npm install" in the terminal to install all the necessary packages (make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the package.json file). After that, if you have everything installed and have your terminal in the same direcetory as mentioned in the previous sentence, use the command "docker-compose build" to build the docker container. Once it finishes building use the command "docker-compose up" to run it. Once it runs you will need to type "localhost:3000" in the address bar of your browser to access the application.

Once the website loads use the search input and button to search for a zip code and get the current weather for said zip code. You can use the "Add to favorites" button to add it to the MongoDB database as well as to the list of favorites that appear when you click on the search bar
